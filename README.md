### 👁‍🗨 What is nod OS?
**Nod OS**, is a secure & fast operating system that looks up for **user's security and privacy**. ✅

### ❓ Reasons?
We're pretty much tired of companies like Google and Microsoft who spend their time snitching on our personal info to spy, control and sell our data, so we decided to put an end (or at least to give you a way out from it) to this.
Our company always had in count the privacy of our people and we're looking for more reliable ways to get our users to be protected agaisnt it.

### 🌐 About nod
🔹 Our operating system is based on C#, C and ASSEMBLY for most of the code.

🔹 The name **nodos** comes up as a reference for the **File System** structuring of this OS.

🔹 We work with ***our own file system*** called ``➰bEFS``, also known as ``bunny Encrypted FileSystem``, made by [@ChocoBonis](https://github.com/ChocoBonis).

### How to install
🔹 Download the [ISO file](https://github.com/xhyabunny/nodOS/releases/download/latest/nodos.iso) on our release section to get it installed either on your USB with [Rufus 3.18](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/download/v3.18/rufus-3.18.exe), or in a *virtual machine*.

🔹 Once those steps are done and you have set up your USB/Virtual Machine to run the OS, you're good to go and use it wherever and whenever you want!
